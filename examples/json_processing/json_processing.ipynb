    "# JSON Processing with fenic\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use fenic to process, analyze, and extract structured information from a complex JSON transcript file (such as those produced by speech-to-text systems like Whisper). \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow covers the entire pipeline—from loading and casting the JSON data, to extracting word- and segment-level details, and aggregating speaker statistics using both JQ queries and DataFrame operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key steps include**:\n",
    "- Loading a JSON transcript and casting it to a structured JSON type.\n",
    "- Using JQ queries to extract nested word- and segment-level data.\n",
    "- Structuring and cleaning extracted data with type casting and calculated fields.\n",
    "- Aggregating speaker statistics, such as total words, speaking time, and word rates.\n",
    "- Demonstrating hybrid processing: combining JSON extraction, array operations, and traditional DataFrame analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical example of how fenic can transform unstructured JSON data into structured, queryable DataFrames for further analysis."
