    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Insights Demonstrated:\n",
    "- **Content-based bias detection** without relying on source name predictions\n",
    "- **Source consistency analysis** across multiple articles\n",
    "- **Language pattern identification** for bias indicators\n",
    "- **Topic-agnostic bias detection** (same source biased across different topics)\n",
    "- **Quality assessment** with confidence scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Practical Applications:\n",
    "- **Media literacy education** showing how bias manifests in language\n",
    "- **Content moderation** for balanced information presentation\n",
    "- **News aggregation** with bias awareness\n",
    "- **Research on editorial patterns** and media analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try analyzing your own news articles or text data\n",
    "- Experiment with different classification categories\n",
    "- Combine with other semantic operations like extraction and mapping\n",
    "- Build automated content analysis pipelines"
